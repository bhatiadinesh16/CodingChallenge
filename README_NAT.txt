Ques: How I modified the challenge?
Ans: I broke down the challenge in small challenges in steps as below:
	—> Reading input from both of the Files
	—> String comparison of one file with other
	—> Searching for * in the string, if found comparing the corresponding part with 	   the string.
	—> Setting output formatting in true and false both cases.

Ques: Any refinements could be made ?
Ans:  The solution I presented has asymptotic O(n^2) but I could have done more formatting with my code if I had more time. Not sure the worst case time could be any better as we have to compare each string of one file with each string of other file.

Ques: Coding design I followed?
Ans:  I followed a simple approach of top-down programming which relates to breaking slightly bigger problem to few smaller problems. 

Ques: How I tested my solution?
Ans: I tested my solution with the cases that you gave and also with few other cases I added putting all of them in a file.
